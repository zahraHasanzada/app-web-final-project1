      <h2>The five major tribes of Afghanistan</h2>
      <p>
        Afghanistan is a country with a multinational and tribal society. The
        population of this country consists of several ethnic and linguistic
        groups, including: Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, Imaq, Turkmen, Baloch,
        Pesha'i, Nuristani, Gujjar, Arab, Brahui, Qazalbash, Pamir, Kyrgyz,
        Sadat, Hindu, etc. The national anthem and the previous constitution of
        Afghanistan referred to these fourteen tribes

      <p>
        Pashtuns are one of the largest ethnic groups in Afghanistan. They are
        concentrated in the eastern and southern areas of Afghanistan bordering
        Pakistan, where they constitute one of the ethnic groups of this
        country. [4] Also, small groups of Pashtuns in eastern Iran bordering
        Afghanistan [5] based on estimates of 38% to 42%. Pashtuns make up 10%
        of Afghanistan's population

      <img src="imge/تاجیک.jpg" alt="" class="afghan-people" />
      <p>
        The Persian-speaking Tajiks and their subgroups, including the
        Farsiwans, are the closest ethnic group to the Persian-speaking
        Iranians, with the difference that the Tajiks are mainly Sunni and the
        Persian-speaking Iranians are mainly Shia. [7] The population of Tajiks
        in Afghanistan is 30.3% of the total population, according to an
        estimate of 12.4 million people. is hit.[8] Tajiks are the largest
        ethnic group in the country of Tajikistan, neighboring Afghanistan. [9]
        Most Tajiks live and work in the northeastern, northern and western
        regions and in big cities, and have professions in government sectors.
        According to the World Health Statistics Organization, the majority of
        the residents of Balkh, Kapisa, Herat, Farah, Badakhshan, Panjshir,
        Baghlan, Samangan, Kabul, Takhar, and Tajik provinces.

      <img src="imge/هزاره.jpg" alt="" class="afghan-people" />
      <p>
        Hazaras are one of the largest native tribes of Afghanistan who live in
        all regions of Afghanistan, mostly in the center of Afghanistan known as
        Hazaristan (Hazarajat). Hazaras speak Persian with Hazara and Dari
        dialects. [10] Due to systematic discrimination against Hazara people,
        for example, the population of Hazaras in many districts (cities) and
        provinces of Afghanistan has not been counted, such as the Hazaras of
        Herat, Badakhshan, Badghis, Helmand, Kandahar, etc.

      <h3>4.Norestani</h3>
      <img src="imge/ozbik.jpg" alt="" class="afghan-people" />
      <p>
        The Nuristanis are people from the branch of the Indo-Aryan people who
        live in a separate region in the north-east of Afghanistan in the
        province of Nuristan, and across the border in the Chitral region of
        Pakistan, and speak the Nuristan language. Many Nuristanis believe that
        they are the survivors of the generation of Greek soldiers of
        Alexander's army, but there is no genetic evidence for this hypothesis,
        but they are more like a group of isolated early Aryan immigrants. In
        terms of morphology, Nuristanis are a sub-branch of the Mediterranean
        race, one third of them have the blond gene.[11] Most of them are Sunni,
        in 1990, their population was estimated to be around 125,000 people, and
        now it is estimated to be over 300,000 people. becomes.

      <img src="imge/نورستانی.jpg" alt="" class="afghan-people" />
      <p>
        Imaq, which means tribe in Turkish, is not the name of an ethnic group,
        but some people who live a semi-nomadic life. The Imaghs were formed
        from the Hazara, Tajik and Baloch ethnic groups in the sixteenth and
        seventeenth centuries. They mostly live in the western regions of
        Badghis, Ghor and Herat, as well as some of them in other regions of
        Afghanistan, and they speak different dialects of the Persian language,
        each of which is related to certain tribes. [13] Their population is
        less than half a million people. About 800 thousand people in 1996. it
        is estimated. About 120,000 Imagh groups live in the north of Khorasan
        in Iran.
